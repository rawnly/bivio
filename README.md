# Bivio (bvo)

A fast, lightweight CLI tool to manage and navigate between your projects.
> this is something i built on top of my workflow, it might not be perfect but it works for me

This tool adheres to the [smol contract](https://bower.sh/smol-contract) 

## Features

- **Project Registry** - Track all your projects in one centralized location
- **Tagging System** - Organize projects with arbitrary tags for easy filtering
- **Interactive Picker** - Quickly select and jump to any project with fuzzy search
- **Git Bare Repository Support** - First-class support for bare repos and worktrees
- **Shell Integration** - Generate shell hooks for seamless navigation
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Releases

Push a `v`-prefixed tag matching the version in `Cargo.toml` (for example,
`v0.2.0`) to build and publish a GitHub release. The workflow builds Linux
x86-64, macOS x86-64 and ARM64, and Windows x86-64 archives. It publishes a
signed packslip manifest alongside them; the release remains a draft until
signing succeeds. Prerelease tags must also match the Cargo version.

Install a published release with `packslip install github.com/rawnly/bivio`.
The release workflow does not currently update the Homebrew tap.

## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Cargo

### Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rawnly/bivio.git
cd bivio
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/bvo`.

### Install locally

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### Command Reference

```bash
Bivio - your project wayfinder

Usage: bvo <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add           Register a project (path, name, tags)
  list          List projects (optionally filtered by tags)
  pick          Interactive picker with fuzzy search
  remove        Remove a project (alias: rm)
  init          Print shell integration hooks
  tag           Add or remove project tags
  config        Read or update configuration
  check-update  Check for new releases
  help          Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help  Print help (see more with '--help')
```

### Adding Projects

```bash
# Add current directory as a project
bvo add

# Add a specific path
bvo add /path/to/project

# Add with custom name and tags
bvo add -n "my-awesome-project" -t rust,cli,work
```

### Listing Projects

```bash
# List all projects
bvo list

# Filter by tags
bvo list -t rust
bvo list -t rust,cli
```

### Navigating to Projects

```bash
# Interactive project picker
bvo pick

# Search for a specific project
bvo pick my-proj

# Filter picker by tags
bvo pick -t work

# Combine search and tag filter
bvo pick my-proj -t rust
```

For bare repositories, the picker will let you select a specific worktree.

Use `bvo pick --json` to return selection metadata for scripts and integrations:

```json
{"name":"bivio","path":"/projects/feature-x","project_path":"/projects/bivio.git","worktree":{"name":"feature-x","branch":"feature/x"}}
```

`path` is the selected directory; `project_path` is the registered project root.
`worktree` is `null` for a normal project or when worktree selection is skipped.
Its `branch` is `null` when unavailable, and local branches omit `refs/heads/`.
Without `--json`, the output remains a single path for existing shell integrations.

### Managing Tags

```bash
# Add tags to a project
bvo tag my-project rust cli

# Remove tags from a project
bvo tag my-project -r old-tag

# Interactive tag management
bvo tag
```

### Removing Projects

```bash
# Remove by name
bvo remove my-project

# Interactive removal
bvo rm

# Remove all projects with specific tags
bvo rm -t deprecated

# Remove all projects
bvo rm --all
```

### Configuration

```bash
# Get config value
bvo config get default_shell

# Set default shell
bvo config set default_shell zsh
```

## Shell Integration

Generate a shell hook to quickly navigate between projects using `bvo`.

### Zsh

Add to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
eval "$(bvo init)"
```

### Bash

Add to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
eval "$(bvo init)"
```

### Fish

Add to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
bvo init | source
```

### Using the `bvo` command

Once configured, use `bvo` to quickly navigate:

```bash
# Open interactive picker and cd to selected project
bvo

# Search for a project and cd to it
bvo my-proj

# Filter by tags
bvo -t rust

# Combine search and tag filter
bvo my-proj -t work
```

## Data Storage

Project data and configuration are stored in the XDG config directory:

- Linux/macOS: `~/.config/bvo/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\bvo\`

Files:
- `projects.json` - Project registry
- `config.json` - Application settings
